  <br><br>
  The goal of this CLI is to speed up the interaction with GitLab and your local terminal environment.
  It provides ways to easily find and clone remote repositories to the local machine with some extra
  actions.

## üì¶ Requirements

- cargo (for building glazy)
- git (for cloning the repositories)

## üöÄ Installation

Clone this repository and run `cargo build -r` within it. Then copy the binary from `./target/release/glazy` into one of the directories of your `$PATH` (like `/usr/loca/bin`).

After copying the binary, create a config file at `$HOME/.config/glazy/config.kdl`.

```javascript
// Configuration related to the GitLab instance
gitlab {
    // URL to the GitLab instance
    host "url_val"

    // Personal Access Token with at least api & write_repository permissions
    token "token_val"
}

// Configuration for the local environment
local {
    // Directory, where the project tree should start
    project_dir "/Users/daniel/Developer"
}
```

The `url` must point to your GitLab instance without the protocol! `token` must be a personal access token with `api` &
`read_repository` permissions.

Then go ahead and run `glazy help` for getting familiar with the CLI interface.

## üî® Usage

### Find and clone repository

```bash
glazy open

# for starting at a certain group with all subgroups
glazy open mygroup
```

## üîÆ Future Features

- [ ] refresh/pull all local repository
- [ ] initial bootstrap of multiple repositories via a layout file
